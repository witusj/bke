	abstract = {Individual student success is influenced by the educational environment and student characteristics. One adaptation of the educational environment to improve student success is the introduction of continuous, or in-course, assessment. Previous research already identified several student characteristics that are related to student success as measured by student achievement, like previous achievements, motivation, self-efficacy and gender. The two facets are investigated in a group of first-year undergraduate Law students in the Netherlands, by examining the relationship of different types of continuous assessment and student characteristics with academic achievement. A questionnaire, measuring demographic information, self-regulation and motivational constructs, was completed by 94 students and their grades were requested from the student administration. Repeated measures ANCOVAs with assessment type as the within-subject factor identified that student achievement is not dependent on the type of continuous assessment. Students with higher high-school GPAs got higher scores across assessment types. Male students performed worse than their female peers in courses without continuous assessment, but in courses using any type of continuous assessment, this gender difference disappeared. Intrinsic motivation was a negative predictor of achievement in courses using writing assignments and mandatory homework assignments. Results from the current study indicate that continuous assessment may be a potent measure to improve male students’ success by closing the gender achievement gap, and that students with high levels of intrinsic motivation do not benefit from continuous assessment.},

	abstract = {Student engagement is intrinsically linked to two important metrics in learning: student satisfaction and the quality of the student experience. One of the ways that engagement can be influenced is through careful curriculum design. Using the knowledge that many students are ?assessment-driven?, a low-stakes continuous weekly summative e-assessment was introduced to a module. The impact this had on student engagement was measured by studying student activity within the module virtual learning environment. It was found that introduction of the e-assessments led to a significant increase in virtual learning environment activity compared to the virtual learning environment activity in that module the previous year, and also compared to the virtual learning environment activity of two other modules studied by the same student cohort. As many institutions move towards greater blended or online deliveries, it will become more important to ensure that virtual learning environments encourage high levels of student engagement in order to maintain or enhance the student experience.},

	abstract = {Chemical Engineering taught as a subject across three Energy Engineering-based degree streams was evaluated considering two cohorts in two consecutive years after the implementation of the Bologna Process in Spain. A regular continuous assessment methodology yielded negative results during the first year. Student insight on course development, own expectations and results, and the evaluation system were then explored via a 33-item survey with participation levels between 41\% and 82\%. Direct answers were evaluated including rank correlations between all items. The 465 correlation coefficients obtained showed stimulating and unanticipated results. For example, it was shown that a severe grading process (external blame-assignment) was only identified as an explanation for a low mark by those students who performed most poorly in the subject and, therefore, had a poorer understanding of the materials. Besides, the feedback received from students was used to implement several changes in both the teaching practice and the assessment method during the second year, such as incorporating exam-like problems in daily classes and setting two midterm exams instead of the final one. The results registered after the second year pointed to substantial progress in student learning. Pass rates also rose from a 30\% in the first academic year to 49\% and 58\% in the two following ones.},
